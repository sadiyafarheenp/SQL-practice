# SQL-Queries

These are the SQL queries I used to fetch data from a database table using **PostgreSQL**. I used a paper company database,based on this **Entitity Relationship Diagram** or **ERD** . ERD will help to understand the data in a database.

**PK** stands for **Primary Key**.It is the column in every table that has a unique value for every row.

**FK** stands for **Foreign Key**.It is a column in one table, which is a primary key in a different table. Each of these will be linked to the primary key of another table.
